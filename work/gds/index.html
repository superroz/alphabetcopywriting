      Government Digital Service
    </h1>
    <p class="info">
    I worked on GOV.UK, the Digital Identity programme, and the Digital Marketplace programme.
    </p>     
    <h2 class="subheading">
      GOV.UK
      <span class="subheading__context">June 2020 to February 2022</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="info">
    On GOV.UK, I was the content product lead on the GOV.UK accounts team. I:
    </p>   
     <ul class="list-bulleted">
    <li>wrote a style guide to ensure content about GOV.UK accounts was clear and consistent</li>
    <li>ran a naming workshop to help the team understand if it was calling the product the right thing</li>
    <li>worked with a brilliant team to design <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2020/11/26/how-we-designed-the-gov-uk-accounts-trial/">the GOV.UK accounts trial</a></li>
    </ul> 
    <h2 class="subheading">
      Digital Identity
      <span class="subheading__context">January 2018 to May 2019</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="info">
    I was the content lead on the Digital Identity programme. I established a strong user-centred design (UCD) community by:
    </p>   
    <ul class="list-bulleted">
    <li>introducing regular design crits so designers could get feedback on their work and make it better as a group</li>
    <li>re-vamping existing monthly UCD meet-ups so they had a different focus each month, for example 'influencing stakeholders' or 'giving and receiving feedback' - this re-energised the group and felt like a better use of everyone's time</li>
    <li>writing weeknotes to help everyone understand what was happening in different parts of the programme</li>
    </ul> 
    <h2 class="subheading">
      Digital Marketplace
      <span class="subheading__context">April 2014 to June 2017</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="info">
    I was also the content lead on the Digital Marketplace programme, which was made up of a number of teams working to make digital procurement in government quicker and simpler. I:
    </p>   
     <ul class="list-bulleted">
    <li>simplified complex legal documentation, reducing a 250-page contract by half, using plain English</li>
    <li>created design principles for writing legal content so content designers and lawyers could work together on content more effectively</li>
    <li><a href="https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/26/great-guidance-is-part-of-the-service/">ran a pair-writing project</a> with subject experts and lawyers to write clear and accurate guidance to a tight deadline</li>
    <li>consolidated disparate pieces of guidance so users could find the help they needed in one place</li>
    </ul>
